# 👋 About Me

Hey!, I'm glad you're here! I'm a happily married husband and IT professional of 20 years, and a proud dad to a wonderfully talented, smart and beautiful daughter currently in high school. Our family also includes Willow, our loyal (but wild) dog.

## 💻 My IT Journey

I've worked in IT for over 20 years, starting in desktop support and gradually moving into a variety of senior roles and responsibilities.

I love learning new technologies and sharing what I discover with others. I also enjoy using PowerShell for anything I can—solving minor inconveniences to large enterprise automations, it's all fun to me (well, some more than others 😁).

Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions for improvement on anything you see here, or don't see!

## 🏍️ Hobbies & Interests

- **Motorcycle Street Riding:** I love hitting the open road on my 2024 Triumph Speed Twin 1200 Baja Orange.
- **Gardening:** Growing things and trying to spend time outdoors is a big part of my life.
- **PowerShell Scripting:** Automating tasks and solving problems with PowerShell is both a part of my job and my hobby.
- **Homelab & FOSS:** I enjoy tinkering with open-source software and running a homelab to learn and experiment.
