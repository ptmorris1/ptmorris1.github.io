## üìñ Introduction

[Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) is an amazing tool for push notifications. It's simple, efficient, and can be self-hosted or used for free (as of this post) at [https://ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh). As a lightweight pub-sub notification service, Ntfy allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop from any script, application, or service.

To make interacting with Ntfy even easier for PowerShell users, I've developed a PowerShell module called **NtfyPwsh** that provides a simple interface for the Ntfy API.

## üì• Installing NtfyPwsh

NtfyPwsh can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery with a simple command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name NtfyPwsh -Scope CurrentUser
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have:

* üîπ PowerShell 7 or higher
* üîπ Access to the internet or your self-hosted Ntfy server

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functions

NtfyPwsh offers two primary functions:

1. üì§ **Send-NtfyMessage**: For sending notifications
2. üîò **Build-NtfyAction**: For creating interactive [action buttons](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/?h=actions#action-buttons) in notifications

Let's explore these functions and how they can be used.

## üåê Ntfy Server

When using NtfyPwsh, you can specify which Ntfy server to use:

* If you don't specify a `-URI` parameter, NtfyPwsh will default to using `https://ntfy.sh`.
* If you're using a self-hosted instance, simply include your server URL with the `-URI` parameter:

```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.yourdomain.com'  # Your self-hosted instance
    Topic = 'private-alerts'
    Title = 'Custom Server Notification'
    Body  = 'This message is sent to your private Ntfy server'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

This flexibility allows you to use either the public Ntfy service or your own private instance without changing your code structure.

## üì® Sending Basic Notifications

The simplest way to send a notification is with a topic, title, and body:

```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message'
    Title = 'Test Title'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

This sends a notification to the **public** "[testtopic](https://ntfy.sh/testtopic)" on ntfy.sh. **Anyone** subscribed to this topic will receive the notification.

> üìù **Note**: The `-URI` parameter defaults to `https://ntfy.sh` if not specified. If you're using a self-hosted instance, be sure to provide your instance URL with the `-URI` parameter.

## üîê Adding Authentication

If you're using a self-hosted Ntfy server or need to authenticate with the public server, NtfyPwsh supports two authentication methods (as of v0.4.0):

> **Note:** As of v0.4.0, authentication uses `-TokenCreds` (API token via `Get-Credential`) or `-Credential` (username/password via `Get-Credential`). The `-TokenPlainText` parameter has been removed.

Ntfy supports both Basic (username/password) and Bearer (token) authentication. In PowerShell, you typically use a PSCredential object for both methods:

- **Username/Password (Basic Auth):** Use your username and password with `Get-Credential` or create a PSCredential manually.
- **API Token (Bearer or Basic):** Use `Get-Credential -UserName 'token'` and enter your API token as the password, or create a PSCredential with username 'token' and the token as the password.

The module will use the correct Authorization header for you.

### üîë Using API Token (Bearer/Basic authentication)

```powershell
# Prompt for API token (recommended for interactive use)
$Creds = Get-Credential -UserName 'token' -Message 'Enter API Token as password'
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.mydomain.com'
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message'
    Title = 'Test Title'
    TokenCreds = $Creds
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy

# Or create a PSCredential manually (for scripting)
$Token = ConvertTo-SecureString 'tk_AgQdq7mVBoFD37zQVN29RhuMzNIz2' -AsPlainText -Force
$Creds = [PSCredential]::new('token', $Token)
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.mydomain.com'
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message'
    Title = 'Test Title'
    TokenCreds = $Creds
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

### üîë Using Username/Password (Basic authentication)

```powershell
# Prompt for username and password
$Creds = Get-Credential -UserName 'admin' -Message 'Enter user password'
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.mydomain.com'
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message'
    Title = 'Test Title'
    Credential = $Creds
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy

# Or create a PSCredential manually (for scripting)
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString 'fakepassword' -AsPlainText -Force
$Creds = [PSCredential]::new('testuser', $Password)
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.mydomain.com'
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message'
    Title = 'Test Title'
    Credential = $Creds
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The module automatically generates the correct Authorization header for you, whether you use username/password or an API token.

## üîò Creating Interactive Notifications with Actions

One of the most powerful features of Ntfy is the ability to add interactive action buttons to notifications. NtfyPwsh makes this easy with the `Build-NtfyAction` function:

```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    URI   = 'https://ntfy.sh'
    Topic = 'testtopic'
    Body  = 'This is a test message with actions'
    Title = 'Test Notification'
    Action = @(
        (Build-NtfyAction -ActionView -Label 'View Dashboard' -URL 'https://dashboard.example.com')
        (Build-NtfyAction -ActionHttp -Label 'Acknowledge' -URL 'https://api.example.com/acknowledge' -Method POST -Body '{"status":"acknowledged"}')
    )
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

You can include up to three actions per notification. The supported action types are:

* üåê `-ActionView`: Opens a URL when clicked (requires `-Label` and `-URL`)
* üîÑ `-ActionHttp`: Makes an HTTP request when clicked (requires `-Label` and `-URL`, supports `-Method`, `-Headers`, `-Body`)
* üì± `-ActionBroadcast`: Broadcasts an Android intent (for Android only, requires `-Label`, supports `-Intent`, `-Extras`)

> **Note:** The `-Action` parameter in `Build-NtfyAction` has been replaced with explicit switches: `-ActionView`, `-ActionHttp`, or `-ActionBroadcast`. Update your scripts accordingly.

### Example: Broadcast Action

```powershell
$action = Build-NtfyAction -ActionBroadcast -Label 'Take Screenshot' -Extras @{ cmd = 'screenshot' }
Send-NtfyMessage -Topic 'mytopic' -Body 'Please take a screenshot.' -Action $action
```

## üìé Sending Notifications with Attachments

Need to include an image or file with your notification? NtfyPwsh supports attachments:

```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    URI            = 'https://ntfy.sh'
    Topic          = 'testtopic'
    Body           = 'Check out this screenshot'
    Title          = 'System Alert'
    AttachmentPath = 'C:/path/to/screenshot.png'
    AttachmentName = 'screenshot.png'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

## üíº Real-World Use Cases

### üñ•Ô∏è System Monitoring

```powershell
# Check disk space and send alert if below threshold
$diskC = Get-PSDrive C
if ($diskC.Free / $diskC.Used -lt 0.1) {
    $ntfy = @{
        Topic    = 'system-alerts'
        Title    = '‚ö†Ô∏è Low Disk Space Alert'
        Body     = "Drive C: has only $([Math]::Round($diskC.Free / 1GB, 2)) GB free"
        Priority = 'High'
        Tags     = 'warning'
    }
    Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
}
```

### üöÄ Deployment Notifications

```powershell
# Notify team when deployment completes
try {
    # Deployment code here
    $ntfy = @{
        Topic = 'deployments'
        Title = '‚úÖ Production Deployment Successful'
        Body  = "v1.2.3 deployed to production at $(Get-Date)"
        Tags  = 'check'
        Action = Build-NtfyAction -ActionView -Label 'View Dashboard' -URL 'https://dashboard.example.com'
    }
    Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
} catch {
    $ntfy = @{
        Topic    = 'deployments'
        Title    = '‚ùå Production Deployment Failed'
        Body     = "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        Priority = 'High'
        Tags     = 'x'
    }
    Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
}
```

### üìÖ Schedule Notifications

```powershell
# Schedule a meeting reminder with action to join
$ntfy = @{
    Topic  = 'reminders'
    Title  = 'üìÖ Team Meeting'
    Body   = 'Weekly team meeting starts in 15 minutes'
    Delay  = '15m'
    Action = Build-NtfyAction -ActionView -Label 'Join Meeting' -URL 'https://meet.example.com/team'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

## üìä Notification Priority Levels

Ntfy supports different priority levels for your notifications, which NtfyPwsh makes easy to set:

| Priority | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `Max` | Urgent notification, highest importance | Critical system failures |
| `High` | Important notification | Security alerts |
| `Default` | Regular notification | Normal updates |
| `Low` | Low priority notification | Informational messages |
| `Min` | Minimal priority, least disruptive | Debug information |

Example:
```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    Topic    = 'alerts'
    Title    = 'üî• Server Outage'
    Body     = 'Production server is not responding'
    Priority = 'Max'
    Tags     = 'rotating_light'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Using Tags in Notifications

Ntfy supports various emoji tags that you can add to your notifications. NtfyPwsh makes it easy to include these tags:

```powershell
$ntfy = @{
    Topic = 'updates'
    Title = 'System Update'
    Body  = 'System update completed successfully'
    Tags  = 'arrow_up,partying_face'
}
Send-NtfyMessage @ntfy
```

For a complete list of supported tags, check the [Ntfy documentation](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/?h=topic#tags-emojis).
