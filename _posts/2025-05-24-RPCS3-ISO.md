# üéÆ PlayStation 3 ISOs + RPCS3 + LaunchBox: The Ultimate PowerShell Combo!

Are you a PlayStation 3 enthusiast who loves to keep your game collection neat and accessible? Ever tried to run an ISO file directly in [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net) and hit a wall? You‚Äôre not alone! RPCS3, the amazing PS3 emulator, doesn‚Äôt natively support mounting ISO files. This can be a real pain for collectors who want to keep their games in ISO format for easy management or archival. But of course‚Äî**PowerShell to the rescue!** Now there‚Äôs a solution that‚Äôs not only powerful, but also integrates beautifully with [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com) for the ultimate game library experience.

> **Note:** This script was initially built to use with LaunchBox, but it can also be used standalone in PowerShell without needing LaunchBox.

## üöÄ The Problem: RPCS3 and ISOs

RPCS3 is a fantastic emulator, but it expects extracted folders, not the raw ISO files you might have from your collection. This can be a real headache if you want to keep your games in ISO format for easy management or archival.  Also extracting all the ISO files creates duplicate storage usage.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Solution: PowerShell Magic!

Enter the **RPCS3-ISOLauncher-Launchbox** PowerShell script! This script acts as your personal game butler:
- It mounts your PS3 ISO file as a virtual drive.
- Launches the game in RPCS3 (fullscreen, no GUI, just pure gaming!).
- Waits for you to finish playing.
- Unmounts the ISO when you‚Äôre done.
- Logs every action and error for easy troubleshooting.

And the best part? It‚Äôs designed to work seamlessly with LaunchBox, so you can launch your PS3 games with a single click, just like any other title in your collection.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (In a Nutshell)

1. **Copy the Script:** Download [`RPCS3-ISO-LaunchBox.ps1`](https://github.com/ptmorris1/RPCS3-ISOLauncher-Launchbox) and place it in your RPCS3 folder (or anywhere you like‚Äîjust update the path inside the script).
2. **Configure LaunchBox:** Set up a new emulator entry that points to your PowerShell executable and passes the ISO path as a parameter.
3. **Play:** Launch your games from LaunchBox. The script handles the rest!

## üì¶ Bonus: Bulk Decrypt Your ISOs

Got a stack of encrypted PS3 ISOs? The repo also includes a handy [`Bulk-Decrypt-ISOs.ps1`](https://github.com/ptmorris1/RPCS3-ISOLauncher-Launchbox/blob/main/Bulk-Decrypt-ISOs.ps1) script. Just point it at your ISOs, your `.dkey` files, and your `ps3dec.exe` binary, and it‚Äôll batch-decrypt everything for you. It even gives you a summary report at the end!

## ü§© Why You‚Äôll Love This
- No more manual mounting or fiddling with virtual drives.
- LaunchBox integration means your PS3 games look and play just like the rest of your collection.
- Robust error handling and logging‚Äîso you know exactly what‚Äôs happening.
- Bulk decryption saves you hours if you have a big library.
